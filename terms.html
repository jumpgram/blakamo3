            <strong>Privacy Policy: The personal information provided to us by
              clients is utilised by our back-end team to configure the social
              media account and facilitate growth to the client. It is not
              distributed with any third parties and remains confidential
              within the Jumpgram team on a secure server managed by our
              back-end. This data is not easily accessible by staff or
              employees and is simply used as a necessary mechanism to grow a
              client&#x27;s account.</strong><br /><strong>‚Äç</strong><br /><strong>Refund Policy: To cancel their trial,
              customers will need to
              cancel Jumpgram within the 7-day trial period by contacting our
              support email or submitting a contact form request. After the
              7-day trial period, they will be automatically billed and no
              refunds can be issued. At this stage, they may request
              cancellation before the monthly cycle ends so they won&#x27;t be
              billed again. <br /><br />Our service requires the client to
              submit a targeting form after subscribing. If in the event the
              client does not submit the account targeting form within 24
              hours of subscribing, Jumpgram reserves the right to evaluate
              the client&#x27;s Instagram profile and determine suitable
              targeting based on our evaluation and still bill the client
              after the 7 day trial period. In the event that the client fails
              to submit the form, we will also attempt to contact the client
              to inform them that they should update us with their desired
              targets.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Billing Policy: The cost of Jumpgram&#x27;s Growth Service is
              $19.95 per week, (charged on a monthly basis). The initial
              billing will begin after the free 7 day trial
              advertised.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Accountability Policy: Jumpgram is not liable for any defects
